### Keep bot files updated
The Kolbot scripting library gets regular updates.  There is no auto-updater for security reasons so it will be up to you to regularly check for updates.
* Open GitHub Desktop and it should automatically fetch any updates if there are any.
* If there are any new updates you should see a button "Pull origin" Click on that to pull all the latest updates!

* If you don't see anything you are fully updated.
* Other places to check for updates: https://github.com/blizzhackers/kolbot/commits/
* The blizzhackers discord development channel will also post any new updates. https://discord.gg/69W7twTm5K

### Compatibility
If you run into any issues with D2Bot.exe launching you can try running it in compatibility mode.
* Right-click D2Bot.exe and select properties.  From there click compatibility.
* For Win 8 if you get issues, try to  "Run this program in compatibility mode for Windows 7"
* Note compatibility will not fix the "D2BS is not responding error"  For that make sure you install the [Requirements](#requirements)
