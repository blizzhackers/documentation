## Configuring D2BS and Kolbot for PlugY single player.

1. If want to play only Single Player and set PlugY stash enabled for all your characters and profiles:

    a) Go to \d2bs\kolbot\libs\core and open Config.js

    b) Find and set the line PlugYStash: true,

2. To set PlugY stash to enabled only for a certain character:

    a) Go to \d2bs\kolbot\libs\config\yourcharacterconfig.js

    b) Add after line18 - Config.SortSettings.PlugYStash = true;

4. In D2Bot.exe make sure the path is set to Game.exe and not PlugY.exe!

5. In-game make sure the first 2 pages of your PlugY stash are empty.
